# Editable Smooth Voxel Terrain in Unity
Smooth voxel terrain is terrain which can be modified in any direction (there are terrain in many games where terrain can be modified only vertically). SVT is just like terrain in one popular cubic-terrain game - Minecraft, but smoothed. In my project, terrain will be also editable while the game/program is running (some graphics tools has similar SVT algorythm, but you can export only static object into Unity project. <br />

**Unity 2019.1.9f1**  <br />
